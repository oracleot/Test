/**
 * If you want to prove your React skills, please try this test
 * TestComponent is a React component
 * getDataFromExternalSource(string id) is a function and it can return an IData object or undefined
 * The id comes from a reducer and the value may change at any time
 * 
 * 
 * WHAT THE COMPONENT SHOULD RETURN:
 * - If myData.age is less than 18, it should render the ComponentA
 * - If myData.age is greater than or equal to 18, it should render the ComponentB
 * - If there is no data, it should display an error message "There was an error"
 * 
 * 
 * TIPS: 
 * - This is a theoretical question, there is no need to install packages.
 * - ComponentA and ComponentB are not real components, just an example. You wonÂ´t be able to render this.
 * - The external data function can return undefined
